This project, **User Profile Validation System**, is developed as part of the **Python: Code2Xplore – 60 Days Challenge (Day 1)** under the **Department of Computer Science and Engineering, SRM University–AP** for the course **CSE205 – Hands-on Python**. The program validates user details such as full name, email ID, mobile number, and age based on predefined rules using basic Python concepts like data types, string manipulation, and conditional statements. If all validation conditions are satisfied, the system displays *User Profile is VALID*; otherwise, it displays *User Profile is INVALID*. The project strictly follows the given constraints, avoiding loops, regular expressions, and advanced libraries, and focuses on strengthening fundamental Python programming skills.
